1) what is react?
React is a library for building user interfaces.

//React runs on a client server as a single page app.

React is often referred as a front-end framework because it is capable and directly comparable to a framework such as Angular or Vue.


2)why would you use react?
a) structure the "view" layer of your application.
b) reusable components with their own state.
c) JSX - dynamic markup.
d) interactive UIs with Virtual DOM.
e) performance and testing.
f) very popular in the industry.

3) state?
components have state which is an object that determines how a component behaves and renders.
"app and global" state refers to state that is available to the entire UI, not just a single component.

4) react hooks?
React hooks are functions that let us hook into the React state and lifecycle features from function components.

usestate =====> returns a stateful value and a function to update it.

useEffect =====> perform side effects in function components.


// creating react-app ==========> npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
code . =====> open vs code in current folder

// components name "first letter should be capital.

5) passing props======>
 1) in app.js ----- <Header title="Hello" />
    in Header.js:=
    const Header = (props) => {
        return (
            <header>
            <h1>{props.title}</h1>
        )
    }

    2) By using destructuring.
      in Header.js :=
      const Header = (props) => {
        const { title, name } = props;
        return (
            <header>
            <h1> { title, name } </h1>
            </header>
        )
      }

    3) const Header = ({ title, name }) => {
        return(
            <header>
            <h1> {title} {name} </h1>
            </header>
        )
    }

    4) we can pass default props.
       const Header = ({ title }) => {
        return(
            <header>
            <h1>{title}</h1>
            </header>
        )
       }

       Header.defaultProps = {
        title: "Task Tracker",
       }


     6) we can do styling in different ways ======> 
      a) using ecternal package "style component".
      
      b) direct css styling. e.g., style = {{color: 'red', backgroundColor: 'yellow'}}
       
    c) in header file below,
        const Header = ({ title }) => {
        return(
            <header>
            <h1>{headerStyle}</h1>
            </header>
        )
       }
        const headerStyle = {
            color: 'red', 
            backgroundColor: 'yellow'
        }
